### Event Management System

#### 1. Introduction
This project is an Event Management System designed to handle event planning, ticketing, registrations, and attendee engagement. The backend is designed to be compatible with both Java (Spring Boot) and .NET (ASP.NET Core) frameworks.

#### 2. Module Overview
The system is comprised of the following key modules:
* **Event Management**: This module is for managing event details, schedules, and updates.
* **User Registration**: This module handles user sign-ups and profile management.
* **Ticket Booking**: This module facilitates ticket booking, payment processing, and cancellations.
* **Notifications and Reminders**: This module sends event-related reminders and updates to users.
* **Feedback and Ratings**: This module allows users to rate events and provide feedback.

#### 3. Architecture Overview
* **Architectural Style**: The system follows a REST API-based architecture.
* **Frontend**: The frontend is built using either Angular or React.
* **Backend**: The backend is implemented with a REST API.
* **Database**: A relational database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server is used.
* **Component Interaction**: The frontend communicates with the backend through REST APIs for all user interactions. The backend handles all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with the database and manages notifications.

#### 4. Module-Wise Design

**4.1 Event Management Module**
* **Features**: Admins can create, update, and delete event details. Users can search and filter events by category, date, or location.
* **Data Flow**: An admin interacts with the frontend, sending requests to the backend, which then updates the database. The event data is displayed to users on the frontend.
* **Entity**: The core entity is `Event`, which includes `EventID`, `Name`, `Category`, `Location`, `Date`, and `OrganizerID`.

**4.2 User Registration Module**
* **Features**: This module supports user sign-up and login, as well as managing user profiles.
* **Data Flow**: User details provided through the frontend are validated and stored in the database by the backend, and a confirmation is sent back to the user interface.
* **Entity**: The `User` entity has `UserID`, `Name`, `Email`, `Password`, and `ContactNumber`.

**4.3 Ticket Booking Module**
* **Features**: Users can book, view, and cancel event tickets.
* **Data Flow**: Users book tickets via the frontend. The backend processes the booking, updates ticket availability, and sends a confirmation.
* **Entity**: The `Ticket` entity includes `TicketID`, `EventID`, `UserID`, `BookingDate`, and `Status` (Confirmed/Canceled).

**4.4 Notifications and Reminders Module**
* **Features**: The system can notify users about event updates and send reminders for upcoming events.
* **Data Flow**: Notifications are triggered by the backend based on a predefined schedule. They can be sent via email, SMS, or displayed on the frontend.
* **Entity**: The `Notification` entity contains `NotificationID`, `UserID`, `EventID`, `Message`, and `SentTimestamp`.

**4.5 Feedback and Ratings Module**
* **Features**: This module collects feedback and ratings from users for events and displays average ratings.
* **Data Flow**: Users submit feedback via the frontend, and the backend processes and stores this data in the database.
* **Entity**: The `Feedback` entity consists of `FeedbackID`, `EventID`, `UserID`, `Rating`, `Comments`, and `SubmittedTimestamp`.

#### 5. Database Design
The system uses a relational database with the following tables and relationships:
* **Event**: Primary Key is `EventID`.
* **User**: Primary Key is `UserID`.
* **Ticket**: Primary Key is `TicketID`, with foreign keys for `EventID` and `UserID`.
* **Notification**: Primary Key is `NotificationID`, with a foreign key for `UserID`.
* **Feedback**: Primary Key is `FeedbackID`, with foreign keys for `EventID` and `UserID`.

#### 6. Local Deployment Strategy
* **Frontend**: Served using local servers (e.g., `ng serve` for Angular).
* **Backend**: Deployed locally using either Spring Boot or ASP.NET Core.
* **Database**: A local instance of the database is set up for testing purposes.
